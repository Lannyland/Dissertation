  abstract = {Wilderness Search and Rescue (WiSAR) is the process of finding and
	assisting persons who are lost in remote wilderness areas. Because
	such areas are often rugged or relatively inaccessible, searching
	for missing persons can take huge amounts of time and resources.
	Camera-equipped mini-Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have the potential
	for speeding up the search process by enabling searchers to view
	aerial video of an area of interest while closely coordinating with
	nearby ground searchers. In this paper, we report on lessons learned
	by trying to use UAVs to support WiSAR. Our research methodology
	has relied heavily on field trials involving searches conducted under
	the direction of practicing search and rescue personnel but using
	simulated missing persons. Lessons from these field trials include
	the immediate importance of seeing things well in the video, the
	field need for defining and supporting various roles in the search
	team, role-specific needs like supporting systematic search by providing
	a visualization tool to represent the quality of the search, and
	the on-going need to better support interactions between ground and
	video searchers. Surprisingly to us, sophisticated autonomous search
	patterns were less critical than we anticipated, though advances
	in video enhancement and visualizing search progress, as well as
	ongoing work to model the likely location of a missing person, open
	up the possibility of closing the loop between UAV path-planning,
	search quality, and the likely location of a moving missing person.},
