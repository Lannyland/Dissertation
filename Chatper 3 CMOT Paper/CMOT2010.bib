	abstract={Although advancing levels of technology allow UAV operators to give increasingly
		complex commands with expanding temporal scope, it is unlikely that the
		need for immediate situation awareness and local, short-term flight adjustment
		will ever be completely superseded. Local awareness and control are particularly
		important when the operator uses the UAV to perform a search or inspection
		task. There are many different tasks which would be facilitated by search
		and inspection capabilities of a camera-equipped UAV. These tasks range
		from bridge inspection and news reporting to wilderness search and rescue.
		The system should be simple, inexpensive, and intuitive for non-pilots.
		An appropriately designed interface should (a) provide a context for interpreting
		video and (b) support UAV tasking and control, all within a single disply
		screen. In this paper, we present and analyze an interface that attempts
		to accomplish this goal. The interface utilizes a georeferenced terrain
		map rendered from publicly available altitude data and terrain imagery
		to create a context in which the location of the UAV and the source of
		the video are communicated to the operator. Rotated and transformed imagery
		from the UAV provides a stable frame of reference for the operator and
		integrates cleanly into the terrain model. Simple icons overlaid onto the
		main display provide intuitive control and feedback when necessary but
		fade to a semi-transparent state when not in use to avoid distracting the
		operator's attention from the video signal. With various interface elements
		integrated into a single display, the interface runs nicely on a small,
		portable, inexpensive system with a single display screen and simple input
		device, but is powerful enough to allow a single operator to deploy, control,
		and recover a small UAV when coupled with appropriate autonomy. As we present
		elements of the interface design, we will identify concepts that can be
		leveraged into a large class of UAV applications.},

	abstract={Video acquired using a camera mounted on a mini Unmanned Air Vehicle (mUAV)
		may be very helpful in Wilderness Search and REscue and many other applications
		but is commonly plagued with limited spatial and temporal field of views,
		distractive jittery motions, disorienting rotations, and noisy and distorted

	title={Probabilistic Path Planning for {UAV}s },
	abstract={This paper introduces a probabilistic approach to the problem of mission
		planning for UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) flying through an area of
		multiple sources of threat. As the first step, this new approach is used
		in path palnning. It is assumed that the probabilistic map of the area
		of operation is available during the mission. Probabilistic map is defined
		as the risk of exposure to the sources of threat as a function of position.
		In the path planning, the objective is to go to a target location along
		the shortest possible path with an acceptable probability of getting disabled
		or along an acceptably long path with the lowest possible probability of
		getting disabled. Depending on the definition of threat, a UAV is considered
		"disabled" by a source of threat when it is detected, hit or shut down.
		The conditional probability of a UAV getting disabled under the condition
		that it follows a certain path is defined and formulated based on the probabilistic
		map of the area. Then, a locally minimizing strategy that leads a UAV to
		the targets through the area of operation is developed. The strategy uses
		the local information of the probabilistic map and the information about
		the location of the target. It is parameterized to change the weighting
		on finding a shorter path or finding a path with smaller probability of
		getting disabled. Finally, the strategies are implemented in single-target
		and multiple-target cases to illustrate the application of the probabilistic
		approach. The paper includes a discussion on using the probabilistic approach
		in other phases of mission planning for multiple UAVs.},

	title={Applications of Search Theory to Coordinated Searching by {U}nmanned {A}erial
		{V}ehicles},
	abstract={Concepts in optimal search theory have been used in human-based search since
		World War II. This thesis addresses the technical and theoretical issues
		necessary to apply this crucial theory in path planning. A typical search
		often requires that more than one target be located. Accordingly, a method
		is presented to locate multiple targets in three dimensions, as well as
		to differentiate between them. However, significant error can be present
		when locating targets from an airborne platform, and the idea of target
		quality is also introduced as a way to describe the reliability of target
		estimates. Flight test results are presented to validate the target differentiation
		algorithm. In this test, five out of six targets as close as 6.1 m apart
		are located and differentiated with less than four meters of error. This
		flight test also provides color information that is used in generating
		artificial target images and understanding the target detection probability.
		Image skew is then incorporated into the detection probability model, and
		a function is derived that predicts target detection as a function of distance.
		In order to measure the effectiveness of search algorithms that use this
		model, the concept of a probability map is introduced. This map can be
		updated as the search progresses, and is stored on a probability grid containing
		nodes that keep track of the probable target locations and the probability
		of detection. Using this tool, a search width is developed for a given
		airborne agent. The search width is then used to derive optimal search
		performance based on a given probability map and UAV. Finally, the concepts
		of efficiency and completeness are given specific definitions in the context
		of discrete search. These metrics are used to develop one path plan that
		focuses on efficiency, and one that focuses on completeness. Example simulations
		are used to illustrate the conditions under which each plan might be desirable,
		and a composite search strategy is presented that combines both plans to
		obtain a superior result.},

		solution approach developed for the general TSSP+1 can be immedidately

		a branch-and-cut approach for solving the symmetric TSSP+1. In the symmetric
		version of the TSSP+1, the distance associated with travel from customer
		i to customer j is the same as from customer j to customer i. We employ
		a Linear Programming (LP)-based cutting plane method for bounding within
		the branch-and-cut algorithm. The cutting plane method utilizes linear
		programming to solve a relaxed version of the problem and uses specialize
		algorithms to identify violated constraints. The violated constraints are
		added to the current LP formulation and the problem is re-solved. The steps
		of constraint identification, constraint addition, and LP solution are
		repeated until no more violated constraints can be found or the LP relaxation
		yields an integer solution. If the LP solution at the end of the cutting
		plane procedure is non-integer, branching on variables with non-integer
		values is carried out. The procedure terminates with a confirmed optimal
		solution when all the branches have been explicitly or implicitly investigated.
		The branch-and-cut procedure is tested on 169 test problems from the literature.
		The results indicate that the branch-and-cut procedure is a viable method
		for producing optimal solutions or tight bounds from the symmetric TSSP+1.

	abstract={The Cost-Constrained Traveling Salesman Problem (CCTSP) is a variant of
		the well-known Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). In the TSP, the goal is
		to find a tour of a given set of cities such that the total cost of the
		tour is minimized. In the CCTSP, each city is given a value, and a fixed
		cost-constraint is specified. The objective is to find a subtour of the
		cities that achieves maximum value without exceeding the cost-constraint.
		Thus, unlike the TSP, the CCTSP requires both selection and sequencing.
		As a consequence, most results for the TSP cannot be extended to the CCTSP.
		We show that the CCTSP is NP-hard and that no K-approximation algorithm
		or fully polynomial approximation scheme exists, unless P = NP. We also
		show that several special cases are polynomially solvable. Algorithms for
		the CCTSP, which outperform previous methods, were developed in three areas:
		upper bounding methods, exact algorithms, and heuristics. Extensive computational
		studies were undertaken to evaluate and compare algorithms. These computational
		studies also examined the sensitivity of performance to problem characteristics.
		We found that a bounding strategy based on the knapsack problem performs
		better, both in speed and in the quality of the bounds, than methods based

		encouraging the inclusion of different subsets of the nodes. By varying

	title={The focussed {D}* algorithm for real-time replanning},
	abstract={Finding the lowest-cost path through a graph is central to many problems,
		including route planning for a mobile robot. If arc costs change during
		the traverse, then the remainder of the path may need to be replanned.
		This is the case for a sensor-equipped mobile robot with imperfect information
		about its environment. As the robot acquires additional information via
		its sensors, it can revise its plan to reduce the total cost of the traverse.
		If the prior information is grossly incomplete, the robot may discover
		useful information in every piece of sensor data. During replanning, the
		robot must either wait for the new path to be computed or move in the wrong
		direction; therefore, rapid replanning is essential. The D* algorithm (Dynamic
		A*) plans optimal traverses in real-time by incrementally repairing paths
		to the robot's state as new information is discovered. This paper describes
		an extension to D* that focusses the repairs to significantly reduce the
		total time required for the initial path calculation and subsequent replanning
		operations. This extension completes the development of the D* algorithm
		as a full generalization of A* for dynamic environments, where arc costs

     abstract = {We consider the problem of comparing complex hierarchical models in which the number of parameters is not clearly defined. Using an information theoretic argument we derive a measure pD for the effective number of parameters in a model as the difference between the posterior mean of the deviance and the deviance at the posterior means of the parameters of interest. In general pD approximately corresponds to the trace of the product of Fisher's information and the posterior covariance, which in normal models is the trace of the 'hat' matrix projecting observations onto fitted values. Its properties in exponential families are explored. The posterior mean deviance is suggested as a Bayesian measure of fit or adequacy, and the contributions of individual observations to the fit and complexity can give rise to a diagnostic plot of deviance residuals against leverages. Adding pD to the posterior mean deviance gives a deviance information criterion for comparing models, which is related to other information criteria and has an approximate decision theoretic justification. The procedure is illustrated in some examples, and comparisons are drawn with alternative Bayesian and classical proposals. Throughout it is emphasized that the quantities required are trivial to compute in a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis.},

The system deals in particularly with detecting when interactions between people occur and classifying the type of interaction. Examples of interesting interaction behaviors include following another person, altering one's path to meet another, and so forth. Our system combines top-down with bottom-up information in a closed feedback loop, with both components employing a statistical Bayesian approach. We propose and compare two different state-based learning architectures, namely, HMMs and CHMMs for modeling behaviors and interactions. Finally, a synthetic Alife-style training system is used to develop flexible prior models for recognizing human interactions. We demonstrate the ability to use these a priori models to accurately classify real human behaviors and interactions with no additional tuning or training},
