  year =       {2009},
  abstract =   {This paper presents a new method to animate the interaction
               of a tree with wind both realistically and in real time. The
               main idea is to combine statistical observations with
               physical properties in two major parts of tree animation.
               First, the interaction of a single branch with the forces
               applied to it is approximated by a novel efficient two step
               nonlinear deformation method, allowing arbitrary continuous
               deformations and circumventing the need to segment a branch
               to model its deformation behavior. Second, the interaction
               of wind with the dynamic system representing a tree is
               statistically modeled. By precomputing the response function
               of branches to turbulent wind in frequency space, the motion
               of a branch can be synthesized efficiently by sampling a 2D
               motion texture.  Using a hierarchical form of vertex
               displacement, both methods can be combined in a single
               vertex shader, fully leveraging the power of modern GPUs to
               realistically animate thousands of branches and ten
               thousands of leaves at practically no cost.},
