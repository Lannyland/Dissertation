	therapies are also presented. Finally, general conclusions and recommendations

	robotics with our long-term aim to support children with autism.
	This paper is part of the Aurora project that studies ways in which
	robotic systems can encourage basic communication and social interaction
	skills in children with autism. This paper investigates how a small
	minimally expressive humanoid robot KASPAR can assume the role of
	a social mediator - encouraging children with low functioning autism
	to interact with the robot, to break their isolation and importantly,
	to facilitate interaction with other people. The article provides
	a case study evaluation of segments of trials where three children
	with autism, who usually do not interact with other people in their
	day to day activity, interacted with the robot and with co-present
	adults. A preliminary observational analysis was undertaken which
	applied, in abbreviated form, certain principles from conversation
	analysis - notably attention to the context in which the target behaviour
	occurred. The analysis was conducted by a social psychologist with
	expertise in using conversation analysis to understand interactions
	involving persons with an ASD. The analysis emphasises aspects of
	embodiment and interaction kinetics and revealed unexpected competencies
	on the part of the children. It showed how the robot served as a
	salient object mediating and encouraging interaction between the
	children and co-present adults.},
