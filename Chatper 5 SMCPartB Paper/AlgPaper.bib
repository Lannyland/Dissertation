	type={Doctoral Dissertation},
	annote={This dissertation shows that the CCTSP is NP-hard and that no K-approximation
		algorithm or fully polynomial approximation scheme exists, unless P = NP.
		It also shows that several special cases are polynomially solvable. It
		further compares different exact algorithms and heuristic algorithms. }
