	abstract={Wilderness Search and Rescue (WiSAR) entails searching over large regions
		in often rugged remote areas. Because of the large regions and potentially
		limited mobility of ground searchers, WiSAR is an ideal application for
		using small (human-packable) unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to provide
		aerial imagery of the search region. This paper presents a brief analysis
		of the WiSAR problem with emphasis on practical aspects of visual-based
		aerial search. As part of this analysis, we present and analyze a generalized
		contour search algorithm, and relate this search to existing coverage searches.
		Extending beyond laboratory analysis, lessons from field trials with search
		and rescue personnel indicated the immediate need to improve two aspects
		of UAV-enabled search: How video information is presented to searchers
		and how UAV technology is integrated into existing WiSAR teams. In response
		to the first need, three computer vision algorithms for improving video
		display presentation are compared; results indicate that constructing temporally
		localized image mosaics is more useful than stabilizing video imagery.
		In response to the second need, a goal-directed task analysis of the WiSAR
		domain was conducted and combined with field observations to identify operational
		paradigms and field tactics for coordinating the UAV operator, the payload
		operator, the mission manager, and ground searchers.},

   abstract = {Unpredictability and complexity of social interactions are important challenges for a low functioning autistic child. The objective of this research is to study how a mobile robot can, by appearing more predictable, appealing and simple than a human being, facilitate reciprocal interaction such as imitative play. By conducting an exploratory study involving four children, we found that forms of shared conventions such as imitation of body movements and of familiar actions are higher with two children paired with a human mediator, compared to two children paired with a robot mediator. However, the two children paired with the robot mediator demonstrated increased shared attention (visual contact, physical proximity) and imitate facial expressions (smile) more than the children paired with the human mediator.},

abstract={The general context of the work presented in this paper is assistive robotics with our long-term aim to support children with autism. This paper is part of the Aurora project that studies ways in which robotic systems can encourage basic communication and social interaction skills in children with autism. This paper investigates how a small minimally expressive humanoid robot KASPAR can assume the role of a social mediator - encouraging children with low functioning autism to interact with the robot, to break their isolation and importantly, to facilitate interaction with other people. The article provides a case study evaluation of segments of trials where three children with autism, who usually do not interact with other people in their day to day activity, interacted with the robot and with co-present adults. A preliminary observational analysis was undertaken which applied, in abbreviated form, certain principles from conversation analysis - notably attention to the context in which the target behaviour occurred. The analysis was conducted by a social psychologist with expertise in using conversation analysis to understand interactions involving persons with an ASD. The analysis emphasises aspects of embodiment and interaction kinetics and revealed unexpected competencies on the part of the children. It showed how the robot served as a salient object mediating and encouraging interaction between the children and co-present adults.},

abstract={Recent research suggests that children with autism exhibit certain positive social behaviors while interacting with robots that are not observed while interacting with their peers, caregivers, and therapists. This paper explores trends in robot-assisted autism therapy, as well as some of the specific therapies that have been shown to elicit desirable social interactions when working with children with autism. Considerations for the design of robots for use in robot-assisted therapies are also presented. Finally, general conclusions and recommendations are made to help further the work of robot-assisted autism therapy.},

Specific, detailed requirements for robots and user interfaces are needed to provide guidelines for the creation of robots that more effectively assist therapists in autism therapy. This paper enumerates a set of requirements for a clinical humanoid robot and the associated human interface. The design of two humanoid robots and an intuitive and flexible user interface for use by therapists in the treatment of children with autism are described.},
