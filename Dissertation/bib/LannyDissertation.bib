	complex tasks has motivated many recent research endeavors with a
	variety of applications ranging from lunar construction to soccer.
	However, much of this research is still at an early stage, and many
	challenges still remain in realizing this vision. A key requirement
	for enabling robustness and efficiency in human-robot teams is the
	ability to dynamically adjust the level of autonomy to optimize the
	use of resources and capabilities as conditions evolve. While sliding
	autonomy is well defined and understood in applications where a single
	human is working with a single robot, it is largely unexplored when
	applied to teams of humans working with multiple robots. This paper
	highlights the challenges of enabling sliding autonomy in peer-to-peer
	human-robot teams and extends the current literature to identify
	and extend six key capabilities that are essential for overcoming
	these challenges. These capabilities are requesting help, maintaining
	coordination, establishing situational awareness, enabling interactions
	at different levels of granularity, prioritizing team members, and
	learning from interactions. We demonstrate the importance of several
	of these characteristics with results from a peer-to-peer human-robot
	team engaged in a treasure hunt task.},

	we define adjustable autonomy as the ability of autonomous systems
	to operate with dynamically varying levels of independence, intelligence
	and control. HCA encompasses adjustable autonomy and interfaces it

	The motivations for human-centered automation are many. They include
	technical issues such as an inability to automate certain aspects
	of a task because of its complexity or because of an uncertain or
	changing operating environment. They also include non-technical issues
	such as a desire to allow for human intervention even when full autonomy
	is possible. These latter motivations may include safety, training,
	maintenance or calibration. The benefits of human-centered automation
	include the ability to partially automate a system when full automation
	is not possible. Other benefits are lower costs because difficult-to-automate
	parts of the system can be left to humans and increased operator
	acceptance of an autonomous system.},

	assisting persons who are lost in remote wilderness areas. Because
	such areas are often rugged or relatively inaccessible, searching
	for missing persons can take huge amounts of time and resources.
	Camera-equipped mini-Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have the potential
	for speeding up the search process by enabling searchers to view
	aerial video of an area of interest while closely coordinating with
	nearby ground searchers. In this paper, we report on lessons learned
	by trying to use UAVs to support WiSAR. Our research methodology
	has relied heavily on field trials involving searches conducted under
	the direction of practicing search and rescue personnel but using
	simulated missing persons. Lessons from these field trials include
	the immediate importance of seeing things well in the video, the
	field need for defining and supporting various roles in the search
	team, role-specific needs like supporting systematic search by providing
	a visualization tool to represent the quality of the search, and
	the on-going need to better support interactions between ground and
	video searchers. Surprisingly to us, sophisticated autonomous search
	patterns were less critical than we anticipated, though advances
	in video enhancement and visualizing search progress, as well as
	ongoing work to model the likely location of a missing person, open
	up the possibility of closing the loop between UAV path-planning,
	search quality, and the likely location of a moving missing person.},

	These distributions are used to build a first-order Markov transition
	matrix for generating a temporal, posterior predictive probability
	distribution map. The map can then be augmented as desired by search
	and rescue workers to incorporate additional information. Using a
	Bayesian $\chi^2$ test for goodness-of-fit, we show that the model
	fits a synthetic dataset well. This model also serves as a foundation
	for a larger framework that allows for easy expansion to incorporate
	additional factors, such as season and weather conditions, that affect

  abstract = {Human-robot interaction (HRI) for mobile robots is still in its infancy.
	Most user interactions with robots have been limited to tele-operation
	capabilities where the most common interface provided to the user
	has been the video feed from the robotic platform and some way of
	directing the path of the robot. For mobile robots with semiautonomous
	capabilities, the user is also provided with a means of setting way
	points. More importantly, most HRI capabilities have been developed
	by robotics experts for use by robotics experts. As robots increase
	in capabilities and are able to perform more tasks in an autonomous
	manner we need to think about the interactions that humans will have
	with robots and what software architecture and user interface designs
	can accommodate the human in-the-loop. We also need to design systems
	that can be used by domain experts but not robotics experts. This
	paper outlines a theory of human-robot interaction and proposes the
	interactions and information needed by both humans and robots for
	the different levels of interaction, including an evaluation methodology
	based on situational awareness.}

	ofthe well-known Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). In the TSP, the
	goal isto find a tour of a given set of cities such that the total
	cost of thetour is minimized. In the CCTSP, each city is given a
	value, and a fixedcost-constraint is specified. The objective is
	to find a subtour of thecities that achieves maximum value without
	exceeding the cost-constraint.Thus, unlike the TSP, the CCTSP requires
	both selection and sequencing.As a consequence, most results for
	the TSP cannot be extended to the CCTSP.We show that the CCTSP is
	NP-hard and that no K-approximation algorithmor fully polynomial
	approximation scheme exists, unless P = NP. We alsoshow that several
	special cases are polynomially solvable. Algorithms forthe CCTSP,
	which outperform previous methods, were developed in three areas:upper
	bounding methods, exact algorithms, and heuristics. Extensive computationalstudies
	were undertaken to evaluate and compare algorithms. These computationalstudies
	also examined the sensitivity of performance to problem characteristics.We
	found that a bounding strategy based on the knapsack problem performsbetter,
	both in speed and in the quality of the bounds, than methods basedon
	the assignment problem. Likewise, we found that a branch-and-bound
	approachusing the knapsack bound was superior to a method based on
	a common branch-and-boundmethod for the TSP. In our study of heuristic
	algorithms, we found that,when selecting nodes for inclusion in the
	subtour, it is important to considerthe "neighborhood" of the nodes.
	A node with low value that brings thesubtour near many other nodes
	may be more desirable than an isolated nodeof high value. We found
	two types of repetition to be desirable: repetitionsbased on randomization
	in the subtour building process, and repetitionsencouraging the inclusion
	of different subsets of the nodes. By varyingthe number and type
	of repetitions, we can adjust the computation timerequired by our
	method to obtain algorithms that outperform previous methodsin both
	speed and solution quality.},

	mean of the deviance and the deviance at the posterior means of the
	parameters of interest. In general pD approximately corresponds to
	the trace of the product of Fisher's information and the posterior
	covariance, which in normal models is the trace of the 'hat' matrix
	projecting observations onto fitted values. Its properties in exponential
	families are explored. The posterior mean deviance is suggested as
	a Bayesian measure of fit or adequacy, and the contributions of individual
	observations to the fit and complexity can give rise to a diagnostic
	plot of deviance residuals against leverages. Adding pD to the posterior
	mean deviance gives a deviance information criterion for comparing
	models, which is related to other information criteria and has an
	approximate decision theoretic justification. The procedure is illustrated
	in some examples, and comparisons are drawn with alternative Bayesian
	and classical proposals. Throughout it is emphasized that the quantities
	required are trivial to compute in a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis.},
