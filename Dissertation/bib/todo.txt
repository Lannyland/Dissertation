Dissertation:
1. Cut chatper 1 down by 1/4.
2. Cut user study description and experiment results in JHRI chapter.
3. Add move endpoint thing in discussion.
4. Sliding authority and flexibility.
[Done] 5. Make sure all scales lower case.
[Done] 6. Make sure to change to temporal scale in all places
[Done] 7. Make sure to change to organizational scale in all places

Manage multiple dimensions at the same time.
Slide end points to assign different authority and flexibility.
Slide no-fly zones?

Shorter time without end point will search local maximum
Longer time without end point will probably move to another probability hill



Journal Paper:
1. Cut down related work slightly.
2. Add Spencer's stuff.



I prefer temporal constraints.  This includes an allocated amount of time along deadlines and task ordering constraints.  See Spencer's thesis.

I prefer spatial constraints.  If you agree, please rework this section.  Also, include things like no-fly zones since this is something that we can add when we incorporate Spencer's thesis work.
