When working with a complex AI or robotics system in a specific application, users often need to incorporate their special domain knowledge into the autonomous system. Such needs call for the ability to \textit{manage autonomy}. However, managing autonomy can be a difficult task because the internal mechanisms and algorithms of the autonomous components may be beyond the users' understanding. We propose an approach where users manage autonomy indirectly by \textit{managing information} provided to the intelligent system at three different scales: Strategic, Between-Episodes, and Within-Episode. Information management tools at multiple scales allow users to influence the autonomous behaviors of the system without the need for tedious direct/manual control. 



However, to make these tools truly effective, users need to clearly see and understand the causal relationships between information change and autonomous behavior change. Information fed to the system can be in the forms of ``user-friendly'' model parameters, datasets, areas of focus, representations of task difficulty, and the amount of autonomy desired. We apply this approach to using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) to support Wilderness Search and Rescue (WiSAR), and show that this approach improves the experience of the human partner in human-robot interaction and the performance of the human-robot team.
