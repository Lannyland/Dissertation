Besides my advisor, I am grateful to my thesis committee: Dr.\ Bryan Morse, Dr.\ Mark Colton, Dr.\ Kevin Seppi, and Dr.\ David Embley.

I would like to thank my advisor, Dr. Michael A. Goodrich, for being such a great
mentor, a good friend, and an excellent example of a dedicated scientist. His thoughtful
insights, both in scientific research and in living everyday life, have always inspired me to
constantly better myself. I would also like to thank the BYU Computer Science department
for providing a wonderful research experience. Most significantly, I'd like to thank
my wife, Noelle, for all the sacrifices she has been making to support my research at the
university, for always been there when I needed her, and for being such a lovely partner!
