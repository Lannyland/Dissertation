\acknowledgments{
I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my advisor, Dr.\ Michael A. Goodrich for his continuous guidance and support throughout the research, for his encouragement, patience, trust in me, and for making this a thoughtful and rewarding journey. He sets an excellent example of a dedicated scientist. His thoughtful insights, both in scientific research and in living everyday life, have always helped me overcome one after another challenges. I am very grateful to have such a wonderful mentor, colleague, and good friend for life. I want to extend my appreciation to the rest of my dissertation committee: Dr.\ Bryan Morse, Dr.\ Mark Colton, Dr.\ Kevin Seppi, and Dr.\ David Embley for their support over the years as I grew from a clueless grad school student to a confident researcher.

I want to thank all those (lab mates, colleagues, reviewers, and etc.) who helped me with my research, whether it was a brainstorming idea, collaborative work, or critiques, for helping me grow intellectually. I would also like to thank the BYU Computer Science Department for providing an encouraging and inspiring research environment, so I can turn my passion about Artificial Intelligence and Robotics since childhood into a constructive career.

Last but not least, I would like to thank my wife, Noelle, for her patience/impatience and encouragement/discouragement during the journey, and my children, Adeline and Isaac, for their beautiful smiles, which inspire me to better myself day after day.
